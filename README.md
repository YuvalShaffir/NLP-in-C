# NLP-in-C
In this program we create a generic markov chain. The program can take 
as input a text file of tweets, and create new tweets by iteself, using the probability of each
word showing in the original text file. 
Also we implement a snake and ladders game board, and we use the markov chain in order to generate a successful route to win the game.
